title: "Repair barriers affecting Australian Biomedical Engineers"
excerpt: "There has long been a tension between biomedical engineers, who seek access to aintain and repair medical equipment, and manufacturers, who seek to prevent access to their devices in the name of safety, liability, and the protection of their intellectual property. This study attempts to understand what barriers to medical equipment repair and maintenance are being experienced by Australian biomedical engineers."

## Survey

A survey of Australian biomedical engineers was conducted from May-September 2025. The survey is now closed. You can review the survey questions by visiting [this page](https://griffithuw.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3ODeikylsqC5Bem).

71 valid responses were received. Preliminary results show broad agreement with the findings of the Prouctivity Commission and with a similar survey conducted in the US.

## Interviews

Survey participants were invited to take part in follow-up interviews to discuss the issues at greater length. Several important themes have been identified. 

If you are a biomedical engineer or biomedical technician involved in the maintenance and repair of medical equipment and would like to participate in an interview to discuss these issues, please contact Yuri using one of the options on the left.
