Thematic analysis has become a popular method in the humanities and other disciplines. However, the process of extracting codes and developing themes can be confusing, tedious and time consuming. This workshop shows how to set up your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) workspace for thematic analysis, including creating the relevant bases and templates. It then goes through the process of coding a short piece of text to illustrate a suggested way to record text codes and themes.
